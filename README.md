# OSSR-library-docker-container
This git project contains the source code needed to create an OCI container with he [OSSR client library](https://escape2020.pages.in2p3.fr/wp3/eossr/README.html) installed.

The `Dockerfile` descibes how to build the container and the `codemeta.json` file describes the OCI container as an executable entity, separate from the Python library it contains.
